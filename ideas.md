# Portfolio Web Page
## General Ideas
- Instead of listing things about yourself make them appear and issapear or have them swap one place between all of them.
- Be daring/challenging with your words.

- Try Lynn Fisher pull string to put sunglasess on.

- Try an opening animation, like everything on the page coming toguether infront the viewers eyes [check out this intro](https://brittanychiang.com). Or like presenting an object that calls for interaction and the whole page comes out of it [see this link](https://www.legworkstudio.com).

- Highlight your advantages, for example being new in the ecosystem, without preconceived, built-in ideas. A clean slate. Maybe reflect it with the design of the page, white, pure, clean and simple. Use space and light. like Gaudi in La Sagrada Familia interior. 

- [This guy](https://www.seanhalpin.design) uses a pretty cool thing on his landing page, there's an eye that follows you mouse and reacts to your interactions with the page. It does a really good job giving feedback and a sense of liveliness to the user. 

- Make a darkmode version with a toggle to change it on the nav bar. 

- If you get to show any landing pages you've created, think of doing so on a laptop and a phone simultaneously like on [this page](https://danspratling.dev)

- List your toolbox with the logos and names like on [this page](https://anniebombanie.com)

- First thing viewers read? 
    - Hey there! my name is Gianfranco and I'm breaking into tech with the help of my friends at codeCademy and their Front-End developer career path! 

    - So far I've learned how to create responsive and interactive websites with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, use Git to track projects progression and GitHub to keep it all safe

    explaining mystery organism program:

    The job is to create objects that simulate the DNA o the new specimen for the research team to study. 

    The program creates specimens with 15 random DNA bases.
    The specimen has the ability to mutate. It takes a random base and randomly changes it for one of the other 3 existing bases. 

    The program includes a function to compare the DNA sequences of different organisms. It computes how many bases are identical and in the same locations and it prints the percentage of DNA the two objects have un common.

    It also includes a function (willLikelySurvive) that checks if the organism's DNA contains at least 60% C or G bases. 

    The program is then used to create 30 instances of the organism that can survive in their natural environment and store them in an array for the tem to study later. 

    The bonus points or project extension are also solved and in the file, the first one asks to add a method that creates a complementary strand. And the second one asks to use the compareDNA method to find the two most related instances of organisms in the sample.

    The program creates objects that simulate organisms with random DNA bases, with the ability to mutate, create a complementary strand, compare its DNA with another organism, evaluate its likeliness to survive based on its DNA base, create samples with specified rules and evaluate which are the most related instances of organisms in the sample.
